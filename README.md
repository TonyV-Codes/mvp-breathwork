This is a project I built as a personal breathwork logging tool for use alongside CBT therapy. Most apps I found are aimed at general wellness or mainstream trends and didn’t meet my specific needs, so I “vibe coded” this tool to quickly log my sessions and track my progress as doing it all by paper made it very messy and stressul to manage the "admin" side of cbt breath work info logging.
